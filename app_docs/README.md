# Application Documentation

This directory contains feature documentation generated by the `/document` command.

## Structure

```
app_docs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── assets/                    # Screenshots and images
└── feature-{adw_id}-{name}.md # Feature documentation files
```

## How Documentation is Generated

Documentation is automatically created using the `/document` command after implementing a feature:

```bash
/document {adw_id} {spec_path} {screenshots_dir}
```

The command will:
1. Analyze git diff to see what changed
2. Read the original specification
3. Copy any screenshots to `assets/`
4. Generate comprehensive markdown documentation
5. Update `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md` with the new entry

## Documentation Format

Each documentation file includes:
- **Overview** - Summary of the feature
- **What Was Built** - List of components/features
- **Technical Implementation** - Files modified and key changes
- **How to Use** - User-facing instructions
- **Configuration** - Any settings or environment variables
- **Testing** - How to verify the feature works
- **Notes** - Additional context or limitations

## Usage

Documentation in this directory helps:
- New developers understand implemented features
- Future work build on existing functionality
- The conditional_docs.md guide what to read for specific tasks
- Maintain a history of architectural decisions

## Tips

- Keep documentation concise and focused
- Include screenshots for UI features
- Update conditional_docs.md entries when adding new docs
- Reference these docs in PR descriptions
